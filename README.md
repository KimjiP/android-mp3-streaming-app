# android-mp3-streaming-app
MP3 streaming app for Android

Note: this app is for a coursework assignment. It queries a server that is not personally maintained by me. It may not work anymore if the webmaster decides to deactivate this service.

This code includes:

1. Running Jsoup for parsing an XML file on a new thread (online data access)
2. Using android.media.MediaPlayer
3. Progress bar while music is playing
